# PHP_to_JSON_form
Based off the UI Interact Missouri Unemployment page.
I wanted to be able to edit each entry instead of deleting the entire entry just to correct it. 

PHP form: appends JSON data to file inside, also displays on index page with form 

No need for databases! Good for simple GET/POST application

Delete button not currently set up to function yet. Still working on it.
